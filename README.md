# Rock, Paper, Scissors - The Ultimate Dueling game
## About 

The game was built upon the schoolyard game of Rock, Paper, Scissors enjoyed by both kids and adults alike. What makes this game unique is you get to play against the computer's random choice.

Because the game is based on the random choice of the computer then the game is based solely on luck.

Why not have a go to see if you can beat the computer [Live Deployment](https://soconne339.github.io/soconne338-project2/)

## User Experience

The UX of this website is very much taken into consideration during its design. The information is clear and the colour scheme is specifically chosen to display contrast between the main elements and the background. From the outset it’s obvious what the user needs to do. The text on the button reads “Let’s play Rock, Paper, Scissors”. Feedback is given in the way the game starts up.

The page is divided into 3 sections. The first section shows the scoreboard. Note how the background color of the scoreboard contrasts against the background.

The second section is made up of 4 buttons. These are the buttons that the user must press in order to start the game. They are the largest element on the page and stand out as the main target point. When the cursor hovers over the buttons, the background color changes to a darker hue and the cursor changes to a pointer. This again provides feedback to the user that these need to tbe clicked tap.

The last section shows the choices made by the user and by the computer. I've made a special effort to surround this information with empty space as it allows the user to focus on the important information. The user's choice is on the left hand side and the computer's choice is on the right hand side. Underneath each of the choices is the text, centre aligned, announcing who won that round of the game.

To reset the scoreboard and start the game again the user needs to click on the clear button to the right of the game button choices. The button is designed like the other buttons but the text clear is displayed and is obvious what the user needs to do.
